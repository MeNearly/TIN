# TIN
Tin(y) IRC Node
A commandline client and bot for IRC

## Archiving 
Its main purpose is to archive day by day somme channels.
It's designed to be multi-server, and it can 'link' channels to reflect the content of one to another, either on the same server or another.

## Client
It allows telnet local connections in order to act like a simplistic normal client (handling messages, private or not, notice, action)

## Viewing
Every logged channel may be viewed in HTML form (day by day), and a live version is viewable too.

*All Written in php, and javascript (viewing)*
